What do the edits in this directory do?

Edits to exf subroutines read in extra set of winds, uwind2 and vwind2
Edits to seaice subroutines have the latent and sensible heat fluxes between sea ice and atmosphere depend on the new winds, uwind2 and vwind2
Edits to exf_bulkformulae do the same as above, but for open-ocean areas, as these are not recomputed by the seaice package

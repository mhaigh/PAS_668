------------
general runs
------------
SIZE.h: tiles and recompile
data: run length, checkpointingX2, monitoring
data.diagnostics: output timestep
run_repeat.sh: budget, queue, walltime, cores and aprun, queue_time, leave_time
prep_run.sh: link PACE?
data.exf, data.cal, r*.sh:  start year

---------------
to use chunking
---------------
Chunking is disabled by default - enable it in sub_run.sh
Set chunkTwo endTime and deltaT in data 
niter0 for chunk 2 is automatically set to chunk 1 endTime in 
 chunkTwo_deltaT timesteps
Permanent checkpoints are automatically disabled for chunk 1, as 
 code can't handle a permanent checkpoint at the end of chunk 1 
 (niter0 has to match filename)
Code produces dumps from chunk 2 that are offset from or interspersed with 
 those of chunk 1 (timestep-based naming)

-------------------
to submit a restart
-------------------
if you are just restarting a run, comment out prep_run.sh in sub_run.sh
you don't need to worry about niter0, just make sure pickup name is right in data file

if you are editing a run, don't forget to copy 'data' over to run directory, 

else if you are making a new run
copy_case.sh
find a checkpoint and copy over to input
set pickupsuff in data
if you want niter0 in new run, sub_run.sh

if niter0 is not zero in new run
change niter0 in data
maybe change something - e.g. diagnostics, ChkptFreq (or why are you doing the run?)
prepare_run.sh
copy over all grid files needed by mit2nc and in the transfer, e.g.
  cp -r ../../PAS_666/run/h*.*ta .
  cp -r ../../PAS_666/run/D*.*ta .
  cp -r ../../PAS_666/run/R*.*ta .
  cp -r ../../PAS_666/run/X*.*ta .
  cp -r ../../PAS_666/run/Y*.*ta .
remove prepare_run.sh from sub_run.sh
sub_run.sh
edit the time header in rsync scripts

PURPOSE: model reads in provided binary files for ice shelf freshwater fluxes, salt fluxes and heat fluxes. Model still outputs what it thinks the ice shelf melting should be.

HOW DOES IT WORK: In the_model_main.F edited code reads in shelfIceFreshWaterFlux_cold, shelficeForcingT_cold and shelficeForcingS_cold from binaries. The file names of these binaries is provided in data.

TO PRODUCE THESE BINARIES: run default model outputting SHIfwFlx, SHIforcT and SHIforcS diagnostics, easiest if each in their own state*.data file. Use data.diagnostics_shelficeFilewrite for this purpose. The outputted state* files will be single precision, but we conver them to double precision to be consistent with other binary input files. Use convertBin32to64 block in GRID_TEST.py to do this. This will also undo scalings that were applied to the diagnostics in shelfice_thermodynamics.F. Copy new double-precision binaries back to input directory, making sure to not overwrite any old ones.
